# Writ — Indian Legal Intelligence

[Website](https://getwrit.pages.dev) | [Vidhi LLM](https://vidhi.pages.dev)

Writ is a fully offline Indian legal research assistant. It combines a fine-tuned
large language model ([Vidhi LLM](https://vidhi.pages.dev)) with an
encrypted on-device knowledge base of judgments, acts, and curated legal notes,
queried through hybrid retrieval (keyword + neural rerank).

No account. No cloud. Queries never leave the machine.

## Installers

Pre-built standalone installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available from the
[Releases](../../releases) page.

### Windows
- Download `Writ-Setup-1.0.0-Windows.exe`.
- Run the installer and follow the setup wizard to install the application and desktop shortcuts.

### macOS
- Download `Writ-1.0.0-Mac.dmg`.
- Open the disk image and drag **Writ.app** into your **Applications** folder.
- Launch Writ from Applications or Spotlight.

### Linux
- Download `Writ-1.0.0-Linux.tar.gz`.
- Extract the archive:
  ```bash
  tar -xzf Writ-1.0.0-Linux.tar.gz
  cd Writ-1.0.0-Linux
  ./install.sh

### Prerequisites & On-Device Setup
Writ requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally for model inference.
- If not already present, install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).
- On initial launch, the application detects Ollama and downloads the Vidhi model (`hf.co/prawinin/vidhi`). If the model has already been pulled, it will be detected and used immediately without re-downloading.
- The encrypted knowledge base (`writ_data.dat`) is loaded locally into application data storage.
